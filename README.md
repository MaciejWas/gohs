Do you like Haskell? Do you like baduk? Do you like event-driven microservices? If yes, you might like this repo.

* This will be an event-driven game server. 
* Might be a tutorial on how to build microservices with Haskell.
  
# How to run
 * with docker compose `docker compose up --build`
 * or, if you have stack installed then you can `stack run` every microservice in `microservices/` directory
